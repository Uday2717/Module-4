Q2)Explain Exception handling? What is an Error in Python? 
Ans) Exception handling in Python is a process of resolving errors that occur in a program. Exceptions are errors that occur at runtime when the program 
is being executed.Errors interrupt the flow of the program at the point where they appear, so any further code stops executing.
